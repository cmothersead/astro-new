Imagine yourself standing outside of a store peering through a window into a display case. Inside is the latest and greatest thing you have ever seen and you can think nothing to yourself but "I want that."

Let's say for the sake of argument that this is some brand new smartphone... We'll call it Phone, Inc's _Omega Series_. It has the latest features, the fastest processor, everything you could ever want. After staring at it surrounded by its promotional banners and signs for long enough you decide that not only do you want it, you are going to get it.

Let's also say that in this imaginary world there are no complicated financial instruments like credit cards or loans or interest rates. In order to buy this new phone for yourself you are going to have to pay in cold hard cash. You hurry home and begin scrounging through every piggy bank and couch cushion and junk drawer to find some money. Eventually you've gathered every dollar you could find and are ready to head back to the store.

You arrive at Phone, Inc and as you walk through the door the first thing you see is a sales clerk standing behind a counter smiling at you. She welcomes you warmly and after exchanging pleasantries you exclaim "I want to buy an Omega!" and place your cash on the counter.

"Wonderful!" replies the clerk as she scoops up your cash. "Give me just a moment and I will be back with your new phone."

After counting the cash, she disappears through a door behind the counter and you anxiously await her return. After a few minutes, the door reopens and the clerk steps through holding a box. You can barely contain your excitement until the box is placed on the counter, and looking down upon it you realize something is wrong.

"This isn't an Omega," you state, slightly confused. "This phone is an Alpha series."

"That's correct, that's what you paid for!" replies the clerk. "You see, here at Phone, Inc, things work a bit differently than you are used to. You provide the amount you are willing to pay, and once I collect it I enter it into our system and the system tells me the best phone that you can afford for that price, which I then give you."

"But I don't want an Alpha," you retort, as you pick up the phone that was outdated 5 years ago. "I'd like my money back."

"I'm sorry, but we don't allow refunds." states the clerk.

"Well then can I at least get change? There's no way that I paid the EXACT price of the phone..."

"No, I'm sorry, we can't do that either. The price you pay is the price you pay. Thank you for coming in, and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!" The clerk beckons toward the door.

As you exit the store, your confusion has turned to frustration, but more than anything you feel disappointed, you are walking out without the phone you came for.

Luckily, you have a job that pays well and it does not take long to recover the money you spent purchasing the old, clunky Alpha series phone. In fact, in few short weeks, you have saved up double what you originally spent, and are ready to return to the store to buy the right phone.

"Welcome!" beams the clerk as you walk through the door.

"Hello again." You say, trying to be friendly, but not quite so enthusiastically as your last encounter. "I would like to buy an Omega please." You lay your money on the counter, confident that this will be enough to afford the new phone, but with a slight apprehension in the back of your mind.

"Excellent." Says the clerk "I will be right back."

Just like before, she counts up the money and disappears through the door behind the counter. In no time at all she emerges, once again with box in hand.

Immediately you are overcome with a feeling of relief. The box is clearly not the same as you received last time. This time you have gotten what you wanted. The box is placed on the counter in front of you and immediately your heart drops.

"This is a Beta Series, isn't it?" You ask the clerk, hoping to be wrong.

"Yes it is." She replies

"I didn't have enough for an Alpha?"

"You did not. Enjoy your new phone, and have a nice day!"

You pick up the phone, admittedly years newer than your previous purchase, and much more capable, but feel even more disappointed as you exit the store.

"Why do they do this?!" You think to yourself. "How is this fair? I have spent so much and not received what I am looking for!"

You begin your journey home consumed by your misery until a few minutes later you pass a friend in the street. At first you are too consumed by your emotions to acknowledge them, but suddenly you notice something in their hand. They have an Omega! You make an immediate realization and rush to greet them.

"Hey! how are you?" you greet them.

"Great! Yourself?" They respond.

"I could be better. I just spent a whole load of money trying to buy an Omega and all I got was this", holding up the box in your hand.

"Ahhhh, yes. They do things a bit differently there at Phone, Inc." Your friend replies, knowingly.

"Yeah they do. I see you got an Omega. How much did it cost you?" This is what you were looking for... A firm answer.

"It was pricey..." You friend says as he states the amount.

"That's 10 times what I tried to buy it for originally!" You eject, shocked by the number you are given.

"Yep, but it's worth it!"

You stay and chat for a while before parting ways. You make your way home still frustrated and disappointed from your visit to the store, and a bit overwhelmed by the cost of the phone, but with a renewed energy; now you know excatly how much you have to pay to get what you want.

It takes over a month, but you save enough to afford the Omega and after all this time, your anticipation and excitement have grown back to the level of when you first decided you would make this purchase. You gather all the money and set out toward Phone, Inc for the last time.

"Good to see you again!" say the clerk as you enter the store.

"You too," you reply coolly as you lay your money on the table. Although your excitement and anticipation are palpable, the bad experiences you have had here before temper your mood. "One Omega please. I've brought enough this time."

"Absolutely." The clerk counts the money and retreats through the door.

She emerges once more and you think to yourself "Finally, this is over!" as you spy the box that's color you have learned while you were saving up is the color of the new Omega phone. You close your eyes as she places the box on the counter and, moments later, open them to peer down upon the reward of this long and arduous endeavor. To your horror, you realize this is not an Omega. The clerk has brough you a Delta series. The flagship product before the Omega was launched, the phone in front of you is no doubt a very good product. It has almost all the latest features, and is very powerful, but it is now a solid second place competitor in the age of the Omega.

"What?! What is this?!" you shout at the clerk.

"That is a Delta series, the best phone you can get besides the Omega. A great purchase, and more than the vast majority of people are willing to buy."

"I know what it is!" you spit back, angrily "Why did you give it to me!? I paid enough for an Omega!"

"No you didn't. This is the best phone you can get for the price you paid." The clerk replies, still friendly as ever.

"No it is not! I asked my friend how much he paid for his Omega and that was it! I've paid it! Give me my phone!"

"Ahhhhhh," says the clerk "I'm sorry, but that is not how it works. The price you pay for the phone is not always the same as the price someone else had to pay. Sometimes it changes day to day, sometimes it changes person to person. But today... for you... this was all you could afford."

"Unbelievable." You lament, in disbelief that you have spent so much to still fall short of your goal. You exit the store and take a seat on the sidewalk.

You think to yourself for a while about all that has happened. You wanted the Omega, but at this point, the uncertainty and the high cost have weighed on you so much that you have begun to question whether you do anymore. You now must make a choice:

Take the Delta phone that you've purchased and cut your losses or go back to work and earn even more than you ever have in hopes that it will be enough.

Which will you choose?
