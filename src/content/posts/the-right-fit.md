At a coaching clinic years ago I heard a phrase that stood out to me as profound. It was a simple idea: _"It is not a leader's responsibility to take care of everyone, but to ensure that everyone is taken care of."_

This meant something, not because it was a new idea, or particularly groundbreaking, but because despite being so obvious it was something I had never thought of in that way. It resonated with many of the ideas I had come to learn in my years coaching to that point, and continued to learn in years after.

### The journey from "me" to "we"

When I began coaching close to a decade ago, I was filled with ambition and goals and ego. I was a 20-nothing kid with a chip on my shoulder about how various coaches and teams had not done right by me and held me back from my potential as a swimmer. My sole mission was to prove to everyone how easy it would be to do it the "right" way.

I'm sure it surprises no one to reveal that I quickly found myself not only wrong, but so wrong as to be out of a job.

I'm thankful that I was surrounded by people who believed in second chances and soon found myself back on the pool deck. However, I still carried with me the belief that I could be the best coach by making the most fast swimmers at any cost. I knew the tricks and the shortcuts, and all the mistakes I had seen coaches make, and I was set to take on the world. However, with each passing season, a less exciting reality began to sink in:

_I, like all who had come before me, was human. I was flawed, and limited, and my influence only extended so far. And most importantly of all, just because I did things the way that I would have preferred them as an athlete did not mean that they would work for the athletes I coached._

As my attitude changed, one thing became abundantly clear about the common theme of success. What was important wasn't the workouts or the technique like I had once thought that it was. It wasn't the facilities or the equipment, like many often claim. It was one simple thing: **relationships**.

### Kids first, swimmers second

The most important factor in the success of what we do as coaches is our ability to create positive relationships. Not only do positive relationships cultivate the necessary ingredients for fast times in the pool, they empower us to create impactful and lasting experiences that help kids learn and grow.

Although it is often said that _"fun swimming is fast swimming, and fast swimming is fun swimming,"_ all of the time drops in the world are shallow and lifeless in the face of what our sport truly has to offer. The fun and excitement that draws many to the pool may be the competitions or the time drops or the medals, but these things all fade in time. What is left are the skills and lessons and experiences gained from being part of the journey. This is what is important about how we define success: first and last, we are dealing with kids on their way to becoming successful, happy, healthy adults, not pieces on a chessboard.

Now, don't get me wrong. I am not pedaling some kind of sunshine-and-rainbows everyone-is-happy-all-the-time utopian nonsense... no. Success is more complicated than that. Life is more complicated than that. And furthermore, that sort of idealistic thinking runs a lot closer to a life of overindulgence and ultimate misery than what true positivity looks like in my experience.

Positivity takes work. Positive relationships take work. They mean caring for someone even when things aren't going well. They mean fighting and struggling for more than yourself. The value is found not in the presence of a moment, but in the journey to the next one. And that was a reality that a certain young coach was very unprepared to face.

At the end of the day, though, it is true. More often than not in the path to success, one must learn to put aside themselves for another... Coaches and athletes alike. This is what we strive for at FRST, and what we believe in.

### An environment where positive relationships flourish

Since those early years of struggling with ego and ignorance I have grown from the role of coaching kids to the best of my ability to helping lead a team of coaches to do so. Admittedly, I still find myself constantly challenged and often unsuccessful in my efforts, but am always reminded of the importance of those words: _"ensure that everyone is taken care of."_

A younger version of myself did not see the wisdom of it, and foolishly believed that the way to see a team to its greatest success would be to swallow as much responsibility as possible and do everything for everyone the way I knew it to be right. In my belief that I could be the best, it followed that the team would be its best if I could maximize my own impact and simply **do more**. However, even for some superhuman being who is _actually_ as good as I thought I was, this task would be impossible.

More importantly than whether or not one person can heroically _do it all,_ the reality is that not all people are perfectly compatible. We are fortunate here in Franklin to have a group of incredibly skilled, dedicated, and passionate coaches to oversee our program, but each of us have unique strengths and styles. Although the overarching vision is unified, and many of our values are the same, the idiosyncrasies of our personalities vary just as much as the swimmers we coach. Because of this, there are often times that some coaches and certain swimmers work very well together and others do not.

Because of this, it is critical that we do all that we can to provide opportunities for positive, meaningful relationships to take root, even if that goal is challenging at times.

### The right coach for the right kid

The challenges arise as we try to promote an organizational strategy that makes the most sense for the goals and aspirations of the program, but takes into account both the overall well-being of the club and its athletes, as well as the flexibility necessary to meet the needs of each athlete. Determining which athletes swim in which group and for which coaches, how to make those designations, and when to prioritize the person over the policy is a devilishly tricky thing to do.

In the past we have tried to draw rules and lines and boundaries to clarify what defines a swimmer in a particular group, but from all of the efforts we have made to classify and clarify over the years, the constant has remained: **relationships determine outcome**. Where two swimmers of relatively equal skill and speed enter a group, two completely different swimmers may exit.
